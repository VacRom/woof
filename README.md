# How to:
Before you begin, make sure to enable sound in the Virtual Box by changing the settings before startup.

To play the game, run game.py.
To try out a tutorial of the engine, run gameTest.py.

I recommend playing through the game at least once (3 to 8 minutes) before reading further.

# Engine:
When I first started this project, I had a number of ideas. The first was a side-scrolling muliplayer fighting game. There were two problems with this. First, having many people playing an action oriented game on a single keyboard was not optimal. Furthermore, I had tried to connect the VM with Playstation controllers but the drivers were not compatible. Second, the game would not be able to run on all VM's since the memory requred to run the game would cause crashes.

Instead, I chose to make a strategy/exploration game based on simple mechanics. It is heavily inspired by The Stanley Parable (and aesthetic choices from games like Thomas was Alone). It should run well on most VM's and utilizes what we have learned about object oriented programming.

The tutorial should cover the basics of what the engine can do but there are more features that I could showcase in future updates.

# Story:
Like the Stanley Parable, this game is an allegory that tells its story through game mechanics. Although I would have liked to add more scenarios (and other features such as dynamic lighting) the code would become exponentially more complex with each addition.

Ultimately, what this story means is up to the player's interpretation, but the most apparent motifs are on choice and decision making. For example, when presented with two choices, A and B, the player also have choices C and D implicitly. Making one choice over another is not necessarily "wrong" but it doesn't make any particular ending "right".
